# Basic Environment

## Operating System

My system is linux Opensuse 42.3. The guide is useful on most kinds of linux system.

## Software we need

+ nasm : an assembler which is to convert the assembly language to binary file. You can get more info from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netwide_Assembler)
+ qemu : a full-system emulater. Here you can learm more about qemu. [qemu](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html)

## How to install them

`sudo zypper install qemu
 sudo zypper install nasm`

## Add them to PATH

` PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/ `

Now we can play with them.
