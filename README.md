# Build-Operation-System

I've learned how to implement some operating ststem library like lock and memalloc, but how to integrate these functions to a practical real operating system is a long journey. Let's begin.

## funtions

### Barebone 

* boot from scaratch 
* Enter 32-bit mode
* Jump from Assembly to C
* Interrupt handling

### Input and Output

* Screen Output
* Input (from mouse and keyboard driver)

### Operating System

* library to call
* file system
* memory management
* process concurrency and schedule

### Some application

* shell
* a text editor

## What's more

It's just a personnel study and game. I'll be glad if you can give more advice.
